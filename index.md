	<p><b>The Winter Fey</b> is a short, festive, & winter-themed one-shot adventure for <b>10th level adventurers</b>, set in and around the tiny isolated mountain hamlet of <b>Brisque</b>.</p>
	
	<h2>Adventure Overview</h2>
	<p>You and your companions have received word from Frankie Crackers a friend of a friend, about the passing away of an old associate, comrade, partner, family member, or advocate, Parkie Smiles the talented and cheeky bard with a heart of gold and more coin owed than owned.
	Frankie Crackers has gotten in touch with you to help her track down the mythical Winter Fey- a benevolent and wish-granting world spirit. The myth goes that spirit visits a small village but once a year upon the Night of Hearths to grant but a single wish. With months of research, Frankie has decided that Brisque is that village and so the spirit itself must make it's home nearby.
	She wants to track down the Winter Fey before the Night of Hearths and secure the single wish for Parkie's resurrection.</p>
